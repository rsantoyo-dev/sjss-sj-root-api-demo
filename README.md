# sjss-sj-root-api-demo

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/rsantoyo-dev/sjss-sj-root-api-demo)

This is a tiny Angular demo showcasing SJSS (super-jss) `sjRootApi` — a typed, composable CSS‑in‑TS API. It demonstrates styling via the `[sj]` directive and base components using theme tokens, responsive style objects, and pseudo‑selectors (e.g., hover/active) all inline in templates or TypeScript.

Highlights
- Angular v20 standalone setup in a single component
- Theme tokens via `sj.palette.*` (main/contrast/dark/light)
- Responsive objects like `{ xs: ..., md: ... }`
- Pseudo‑selectors with `sj.hover(...)` and `sj.active(...)`
- Typed `SjStyle[]` built in TS helpers
